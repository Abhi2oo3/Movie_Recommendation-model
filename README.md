## About

The Movie Recommendation System is a Python-based project that leverages natural language processing techniques and cosine similarity to provide movie recommendations based on user input. This system helps users discover new movies similar to their favorites by analyzing movie genre, keywords, taglines, cast, and directors.



## Getting Started

To get started with the Movie Recommendation System, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git

## Usage

1.Run the movie_recommendation.py script:
python movie_recommendation.py

2.Enter the name of your favorite movie when prompted.

3.Receive a list of recommended movies based on textual similarity.

## Features

1.Recommends movies based on user input.

2.Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

3.Provides options for both top 30 and top 10 movie recommendations.

4.Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## How it Works

The Movie Recommendation System processes the following steps:

1.Imports and prepares the movie dataset.

2.Converts textual features (genre, keywords, tagline, cast, director) into TF-IDF vectors.

3.Calculates cosine similarity scores between movies.

4.Takes user input for their favorite movie.

5.Finds the closest matching movie title in the dataset.

6.Computes recommendation scores and sorts movies by similarity.

7.Displays the top recommended movies to the user.
